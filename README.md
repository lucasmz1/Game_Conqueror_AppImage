# Game Conqueror AppImage

This is an unofficial package.

Must be run as sudo or super user in order to get access to the process running under your system to apply the cheat. We couldn't get the polkit working.

This package was made using [pkg2appimage](https://github.com/AppImageCommunity/pkg2appimage)

If you're going to package this yourself please don't use archimage because the pkg recipe there is even more experimental.

Pull requests are more than welcome. We really need to fix the polkit issue but dont know how to (already made an [issue](https://github.com/scanmem/scanmem/issues/445) on the projects github)
